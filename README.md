## Requirements ##
- 64-bit Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.9.0 (or later). See https://pytorch.org for PyTorch install instructions.
- CUDA toolkit 11.1 or later.
- GCC 7 or later compilers. The recommended GCC version depends on your CUDA version; see for example, CUDA 11.4 system requirements.
- If you run into problems when setting up the custom CUDA kernels, we refer to the [Troubleshooting docs](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md#why-is-cuda-toolkit-installation-necessary) of the original StyleGAN3 repo and the following issues: https://github.com/autonomousvision/stylegan_xl/issues/23.
- Windows user struggling installing the env might find https://github.com/autonomousvision/stylegan_xl/issues/10
  helpful.
- Use the following commands with Miniconda3 to create and activate your PG Python environment:
  - ```conda env create -f environment.yml```
  - ```conda activate sgxl```
